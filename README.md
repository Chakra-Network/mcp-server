A native integration with Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol). Allows you to interact with your database and subscribed data shares using natural language.

## Features
- **Natural Language Queries**: Query your database using natural language.
- **Data Share Interactions**: Interact with subscribed data shares. For example, if you have subscribed to a financial data share, you can ask questions like "What is the stock price of Tesla?"
- **Database Management**: Create, update, and delete tables.

## Demo

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods). On MacOS, you can install it using Homebrew: `brew install uv`.

## Installation

### Automated Using OpenTools (Easier)

Install [OpenTools](https://opentools.com/docs/registry/quickstart#prerequisites) prerequisites. 

Then run:
```bash
npx opentools@latest i chakra
```


### Manual Setup (More Work)

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
- On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["chakra-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "db_session_key": "YOUR_DB_SESSION_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Disclaimers 

- MCP is extremely early. The experience in Claude Desktop is suboptimal - every time you use the server, you have to grant access explicitly. This is a design decision on Anthropic's part and is not yet configurable.
- Setup is rough around the edges. We have worked closely with the folks at OpenTools to make this as seamless as possible, but there is room for improvement. We are looking forward to an MCP GUI experience in the future, but for now, users must use the command-line. 
- Today, the server runs on the user's local machine. Anthropic's roadmap includes a [hosted server option](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/development/roadmap#remote-mcp-support), which we will support. This will make authentication, setup, and performance much better.
